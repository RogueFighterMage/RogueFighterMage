**Running Instructions**

- The Windows executable was compiled using clang 3.9.1 targeting i686-w64-mingw for 32bit and 64bit Windows. DLLs are included for mingw, and SDL 2.0.5. It was tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10, with an Intel Xeon E5-2676 processor.

- The macOS .app bundle was compiled using Apple LLVM clang version 800.0.42.1, and it is fully codesigned. It was tested on a circa 2015 MacBook Air running macOS Sierra 10.12.2 and on a circa 2015 iMac running Sierra 10.12.3.

- The Linux binary version of RogueFighterMage was dynamically linked against sdl2, sdl2-ttf and sdl2-image. If you are using this Linux binary, you must have the sdl2, sdl2-ttf and sdl2-image libraries installed. To install these libraries under Debian 8, use the command "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0". For installation on other Linux distributions, check out https://www.libsdl.org/ https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/ and https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/. The Linux binary was compiled by clang version 3.5.0-10, and dynamically linked against gcc 4.9's libstdc++. It was tested on Debian 8, i686 running on a VirtualBox (version 5.0.28).

- The [7DRL version](https://github.com/RogueFighterMage/RogueFighterMage/blob/50eb315ec5cc3f64afa3df7798d5ef64a66a3093/RogueFighterMage-1.1.zip) is a macOS executable, tested on a circa 2014 MacBook Air with Sierra 10.12.2. It has some issues on higher resolution monitors, and also must be run on the command line with the current directory set to the same directory that the executable is in. The version 1.1c builds are the same as the 7DRL version but with some display issues fixed, and support for more platforms.
