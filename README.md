You control a party of three characters in their quest to kill the Goblin King. Meet Rogue, Fighter and Mage. Each of them has strengths you'll have to play to and weaknesses you'll have to work around. The Goblin Caves are treacherous: full of secrets, traps, monsters and powerful magic [7DRL].

**Features:**

- Simultaneous multi-character party system.
- Gain priority to react instantly to your enemy's spells. You can win magic duels, or lay down covering fire.
- Enjoy all the traditional roguelike goodies: press w to wield your sword.

**Running Instructions**

- The Linux binary version of RogueFighterMage is dynamically linked against sdl2, sdl2-ttf and sdl2-image. If you are using Linux you must have these libraries installed to play RogueFighterMage. To install these libraries for Debian 8, use the command "sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-image-2.0-0 libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0". For installation on other Linux distributions, check out https://www.libsdl.org/ https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/ and https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/.

- RogueFighterMage was compiled by clang version 3.5.0-10 linked against gcc 4.9's libstdc++ and tested on Debian 8, i686 running on a VirtualBox (version 5.0.28).

- The [7DRL version](https://github.com/RogueFighterMage/RogueFighterMage/blob/50eb315ec5cc3f64afa3df7798d5ef64a66a3093/RogueFighterMage-1.1.zip) is a macOS executable, tested on a circa 2014 MacBook Air with Sierra 10.12.2. It has some issues on higher resolution monitors, and also must be run on the command line with the current directory set to the same directory that the executable is in. The version 1.1c builds are the same as the 7DRL version but with some display issues fixed, and support for more platforms.
